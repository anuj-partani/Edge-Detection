# Edge-Detection
Real-time Edge Detection on Xilinx FPGA

**Project Overview:**
This repository contains Verilog modules for a real-time image processing pipeline on FPGA. 
It processes 1920x1080 HD video streams, converting RGB to grayscale, buffering image data, and applying edge detection with a Sobel filter.
Designed for AXI4-Stream interfaces, the modules support efficient, scalable, and modular implementation.
